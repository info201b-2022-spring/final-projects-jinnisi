# An introduction of the problem domain and dataset (feel free to borrow language you used in your brainstorm assignment).
The datasets we chose to use were "The top 50 songs in spotify", "Spotify Top 100 Charts", "Spotify Music Analysis", "Spotify 2018 Tracks", 
and "Top 50 spotify songs in each country". We chose to focus on these datasets because they contain a lot of features that we could use to
answer the questions we brainstormed. Each datatset also focused on different considerations such as year, country, or popularity. We chose 
to base our project based on this field because we all enjoy music and it is a part of our daily lives. We chose to create charts on Artist 
Type Popularity, Danceability, and Energy. One of the problems we were considering was 
  
# A paragraph of summary information, citing at least 5 values calculated from the data.

# A table of  aggregated data (e.g., that has been "grouped" by one of your features).
 
# Three charts that display information from the data (what you visualize is up to you). 
The three charts are located in another file called "Exploratory Data Analysis" where we have charts for "Energy v Danceability", "Danceability",
and "Artist Type Popularity".
